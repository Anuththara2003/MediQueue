üìñ Project Overview

MediQueue is a smart healthcare queue and appointment management system that connects patients with doctors and clinics in Sri Lanka.
The system features multiple user roles: Patients, who can register, book appointments, and track their queue positions, and Admins/Doctors, who can manage appointments, patients, and statistics.

This project is built using a modern layered architecture with a Spring Boot backend providing secure RESTful APIs, and a React (Vite) frontend for user interaction.

‚ú® Key Features
For Patients:

Secure registration with Google Authentication.

JWT-based login and role-based redirection.

Dashboard to manage personal profile and medical history.

Book appointments online with real-time status updates.

Track live queue position and estimated waiting time.

Receive SMS notifications (appointment confirmations, reminders, queue updates) via Twilio API.

View nearby clinics/pharmacies with Google Maps integration.

For Admins/Doctors:

Secure login with JWT-based authentication.

Dashboard to manage doctor schedules, patients, and statistics.

Manage and monitor appointment queues.

View and respond to patient feedback.
